<b>1. General questions.</b><br> 
<a name="1.1"> 1.1 What is the TUN ? </a><br> 
&nbsp;The TUN is Virtual Point-to-Point network device.<br> 
&nbsp;TUN driver was designed as low level kernel support for<br> 
&nbsp;IP tunneling. It provides to userland application<br> 
&nbsp;two interfaces:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- /dev/tunX	- character device;<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- tunX	- virtual Point-to-Point interface.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;Userland application can write IP frame to /dev/tunX<br> 
&nbsp;and kernel will receive this frame from tunX interface. <br> 
&nbsp;In the same time every frame that kernel writes to tunX <br> 
&nbsp;interface can be read by userland application from /dev/tunX<br> 
&nbsp;device.<br> 
<br> 
<a name="1.2"> 1.2 What is the TAP ? </a><br> 
&nbsp;The TAP is a Virtual Ethernet network device.<br> 
&nbsp;TAP driver was designed as low level kernel support for<br> 
&nbsp;Ethernet tunneling. It provides to userland application<br> 
&nbsp;two interfaces:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- /dev/tapX	- character device;<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- tapX	- virtual Ethernet interface.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;Userland application can write Ethernet frame to /dev/tapX<br> 
&nbsp;and kernel will receive this frame from tapX interface. <br> 
&nbsp;In the same time every frame that kernel writes to tapX <br> 
&nbsp;interface can be read by userland application from /dev/tapX<br> 
&nbsp;device.<br> 
<br> 
<a name="1.3"> 1.3 What platforms are supported by TUN/TAP driver ? </a><br> 
&nbsp;Currently driver has been written for 3 Unices:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linux kernels 2.2.x, 2.4.x <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FreeBSD 3.x, 4.x, 5.x<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solaris 2.6, 7.0, 8.0<br> 
<br> 
<a name="1.4"> 1.4 What is TUN/TAP driver used for? </a><br> 
&nbsp;As mentioned above, main purpose of TUN/TAP driver is tunneling. <br> 
&nbsp;It used by VTun (http://vtun.info).<br> 
<br> 
<a name="1.5"> 1.5 How does Virtual network device actually work ?  </a><br> 
&nbsp;Virtual network device can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or<br> 
&nbsp;Ethernet device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical <br> 
&nbsp;media, receives them from user space program and instead of sending <br> 
&nbsp;packets via physical media sends them to the user space program. <br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;Let's say that you configured IPX on the tap0, then whenever <br> 
&nbsp;kernel sends any IPX packet to tap0, it is passed to the application<br> 
&nbsp;(VTun for example). Application encrypts, compresses and sends it to <br> 
&nbsp;the other side over TCP or UDP. Application on other side decompress <br> 
&nbsp;and decrypts them and write packet to the TAP device, kernel handles <br> 
&nbsp;the packet like it came from real physical device.<br> 
<br> 
<a name="1.6"> 1.6 What is the difference between TUN driver and TAP driver? </a><br> 
&nbsp;TUN works with IP frames. TAP works with Ethernet frames.<br> 
<br> 
<a name="1.7"> 1.7 What is the difference between BPF and TUN/TAP driver? </a><br> 
&nbsp;BFP is a advanced packet filter. It can be attached to existing<br> 
&nbsp;network interface. It does not provide virtual network interface.<br> 
&nbsp;TUN/TAP driver does provide virtual network interface and it is possible<br> 
&nbsp;to attach BPF to this interface.<br> 
<br> 
<a name="1.8"> 1.8 Does TAP driver support kernel Ethernet bridging? </a><br> 
&nbsp;Yes. Linux and FreeBSD drivers support Ethernet bridging. <br>
