Universal TUN/TAP device driver Frequently Asked Question.
   
1. What is the TUN ?
The TUN is Virtual Point-to-Point network device.

2. What is the TAP ?
The TAP is a Virtual Ethernet network device.

3. What platforms are supported by TUN/TAP driver ?
Currently driver has been written for 3 Unices:
   Linux kernels 2.2.x, 2.4.x 
   FreeBSD 3.x, 4.x
   Solaris 7.0, 8.0 (beta stage)

4. How does Virtual network device actually work ? 
Virtual network device can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or
Ethernet device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical 
media, receives them from user space program and instead of sending 
packets via physical media writes them to the user space program. 

Let's say that you configured IPX on the tap0, then whenever 
kernel sends any IPX packet to tap0, it is passed to the application
(VTun for example). Application encrypts, compresses and sends it to 
the other side over TCP or UDP. Application on other side decompress 
and decrypts them and write packet to the TAP device, kernel handles 
the packet like it came from real physical device.
