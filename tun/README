1. Description
  TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space programs. 
  It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet device, which 
  instead of receiving packets from a physical media, receives them from 
  user space program and instead of sending packets via physical media 
  writes them to the user space program. 

  When a program opens /dev/tunX or /dev/tapX, driver creates and 
  registers corresponding net device tunX or tapX. After a program closed 
  above devices, driver will automatically delete tunXX or tapXX device 
  and all routes corresponding to it.

  This package(http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun) contains two simple example 
  programs how to use tun and tap devices. Both programs works like 
  bridge between two network interfaces.
  br_select.c - bridge based on select system call.
  br_sigio.c  - bridge based on async io and SIGIO signal.
  However the best example is VTun http://vtun.sourceforge.net :))  

2. Installation
  Run './configure' to configure the driver.

  Run 'make install' to compile and install driver module and to create 
  /dev/tunXX and /dev/tapXX device nodes.

  Add 'insmod tun' to one of the startup rc files.
