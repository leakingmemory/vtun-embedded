#
# Create an env-file for each systemd client service like:
# /etc/vtunemd/sample-service.env
#
# Then:
# systemctl enable vtunemd@sample-service
# systemctl start vtunemd@sample-service
#
# The systemd client will read the env-file to determine which
# hostname to connect to.

HOSTNAME=connect-to.example.com
